# TODO
- topBar:
    - gnome-like topBar
    - the nav links simulate open windows in gnome
    - proper placement of date/time
    - shutdown button
    - button for quick links
    - responsive version (might have to ditch ubuntu-theming for phone sizes)
- dock:
    - an gnome-like dock
    - with links to our various social media handles (and other quick links)
    - the links should be icons (which invert/change colour on hover to look nice)
    - the dock will always be visible (like the topBar) so it should look good
- Responsive design:
    - desktop sizes: the topBar at the top, a terminal window in the body, the dock to the left, idk what to the right
    - phone sizes: the topBar at the top (with a hamburger menu for the nav links), a terminal window in the middle, the dock at the bottom (like the macOs dock)

# Guidelines:
- push major changes through a separate branch (or fork)
- be a bit descriptive in commits
- branching
    - branch naming:
        - your name
        - in the format: add-feature-name
    - we still need to figure out a system to prune uneeded branches after merging

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
