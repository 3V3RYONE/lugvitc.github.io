                <h3>Filesystems</h3>
                <p>
                    Any operating system needs to access and manipulate the
                    files stored on the disk. However, for a computer, the data
                    for on a disk is just a big blob of 1's and 0's. The OS
                    needs to know which data is in which file and how to make
                    sense of it. To solve this, data on a file is stored
                    according to a set of rules called a <em>filesystem</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are a lot of filesystems out there, some major ones
                    are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>FAT (File Allocation Table): ...</li>
                    <li>
                        NTFS (): A propietary filesystem used mainly by MS
                        Windows.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        EXT family(ext2, ext3, ext4): Filesystems used by most
                        Linux Distributions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Linux Filesystem Heirarchy (FSH)</h3>
                <p>
                    Those of you familiar with Windows would be used to files
                    being stored in different <em>drives</em> shown by a letter.
